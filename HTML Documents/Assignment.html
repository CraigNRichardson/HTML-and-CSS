<h4>Laddie Boy in the White House</h4>

<p>
Remember that time when Laddie Boy, Warren Harding's Airedale Terrier was given his own official
<a href="dog.html">White House portrait</a>?
  </p>
  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laddie_Boy">
    Laddie Boy was a faithful dog. When the president played golf and hit a tree, Laddie Boy would run up to the tree and retrieve the ball. Laddie Boy had his own hand carved chair to sit in during Cabinet meetings. The White House held birthday parties for the dog, invited other neighborhood dogs to join, and served them dog biscuit cake. Newspapers published mock interviews with the dog.
  </blockquote>
<p>
  A short time following the honor of receiving an official White House portrait, President Harding
  suffered a heart attack and died in office. Harding's Vice President, Calvin Coolidge assumed
  the presidency along with his own Airedale Terrier, Paul Pry. Interestingly, Paul Pry was
  Laddie Boy's brother.
